A simple python library for imaging protoplanetary disc simulated with 2D FARGO.

For more details and examples see the __disc_imaging.ipynb__ jupyter notebook.

Note that I created this library with the 'quick and dirty' behaviour as a Summer Student at Konkoly Observatory in 2016. Thus I reccommend to use my code carefuly and modify it to your own taste! Also take into account that this is my first code uploaded to github.

Dependencies
============

The required dependiences to run the script:

- Python_ version 3.0+
- Numpy_ >= 1.11.3
- Matplotlib_ >= 2.0

The script was tested on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS release.

Contribution & Development
==========================

For development reccomended to use Git_ verson control tool.

The package goal is to be an alternative tool for the visulaization for the output of 2D FARGO simulations using python. Any contribution should be done trough GitHub_ pull request system. All submitted code should be well-commented and documented. It is reccomended to also submit an example for the submitted funcitons.
