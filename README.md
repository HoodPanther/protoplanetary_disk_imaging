# Python library for protoplanetary disk imaging
A simple python library for imaging protoplanetary disc simulated with 2D FARGO.

For more details and examples see the disc_imaging.ipynb jupyter notebook.

Note that I created this library with the 'quick and dirty' behaviour, thus I reccommend to use my code carefuly and modify it to your own taste!
