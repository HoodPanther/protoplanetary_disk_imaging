# Python library for protoplanetary disk imaging
A simple python library for imaging protoplanetary disc simulated with 2D FARGO.

For more details and examples see the __disc_imaging.ipynb__ jupyter notebook.

Note that I created this library with the 'quick and dirty' behaviour as a Summer Student at Konkoly Observatory in 2016. Thus I reccommend to use my code carefuly and modify it to your own taste! Also this is my first code uploaded to github.
