# Python library for protoplanetary disk imaging
A simple python library for imaging protoplanetary disc simulated with 2D FARGO.

For more details and examples see the disc_imaging.ipynb jupyter notebook.

Note that I created this functions with the 'quick and die√≥rty' way, thus I reccommend to modify my code to your own taste!
